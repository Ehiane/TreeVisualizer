## Features

### Supported Tree Types
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Basic binary tree with sorted properties
- **AVL Tree** - Self-balancing binary search tree with height balancing
- **B-Tree** - Multi-way search tree optimized for disk access
- **B+ Tree** - Variant of B-tree with all values in leaf nodes and linked leaves
- **Red-Black Tree** - Self-balancing binary search tree with color properties
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)** - Tree for efficient string storage and prefix operations

### Tree Operations
- **Build**: Construct trees from array input (or words for Trie) with step-by-step animation
- **Insert**: Add new values/words with animated rebalancing (for AVL and Red-Black trees)
- **Delete**: Remove values/words with animated tree restructuring
- **Search**: Visualize the search process through the tree
- **Skip Animation**: Toggle to perform operations instantly

### Traversal Algorithms
Animate and visualize the following traversal methods:
- **In-order Traversal** (Left ‚Üí Root ‚Üí Right) - Available for binary trees
- **Pre-order Traversal** (Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right) - Available for binary trees
- **Post-order Traversal** (Left ‚Üí Right ‚Üí Root) - Available for binary trees
- **Level-order Traversal** (Breadth-First Search) - Available for all trees
- **Leaf-order Traversal** - Sequential traversal of leaf nodes (B+ Trees only)

### Interactive Canvas
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large trees with mouse drag and zoom controls
- **Auto-Layout**: Automatic positioning of nodes for optimal visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch tree structure change as you modify it
- **Highlight System**: Color-coded highlighting for different operations
  - Green for insertions
  - Red for deletions
  - Blue for searches
- **Operation Indicators**: Visual display of current value being processed and remaining values

### User Interface
- **Command Palette** (`Ctrl/Cmd + K`): Quick access to all actions
- **Slash Menu** (`/`): Context-aware command shortcuts
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Control playback speed and navigate through traversal steps
- **Step Log Panel**: Track each step of the traversal with detailed information
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes for comfortable viewing
- **Collapsible Sidebars**: Maximize workspace by hiding panels

## Tree Types Explained

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
Basic binary tree where left children are smaller and right children are larger than their parent. Good for learning fundamental tree concepts.

### AVL Tree
Self-balancing BST that maintains height balance through rotations. Guarantees O(log n) operations by keeping the height difference between subtrees ‚â§ 1.

### B-Tree
Multi-way search tree optimized for systems that read/write large blocks of data. Each node can have multiple keys and children. Configurable minimum degree (t) determines node capacity.

### B+ Tree
Variant of B-Tree where all values are stored in leaf nodes, and internal nodes only store keys for navigation. Leaf nodes are linked for efficient range queries.

### Red-Black Tree
Self-balancing BST where nodes are colored red or black. Maintains balance through color-flipping and rotations, ensuring O(log n) operations with less strict balancing than AVL trees.

### Trie (Prefix Tree)
Tree structure for storing strings where each path from root to leaf represents a word. Efficient for prefix-based operations like autocomplete.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TreeVisualizer.git
cd TreeVisualizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Select a Tree Type**: Choose from the home page (BST, AVL, B-Tree, B+ Tree, Red-Black, or Trie)
2. **Build a Tree**:
   - For numeric trees: Enter values in array format `[10, 5, 15, 3, 7]` or comma-separated `10, 5, 15, 3, 7`
   - For Trie: Enter words comma-separated `cat, dog, car, cart`
   - For B-Trees/B+ Trees: Set minimum degree (t) before building
3. **Perform Operations**:
   - Insert: Add new values/words to the existing tree
   - Delete: Remove values/words from the tree
   - Search: Find values/words in the tree
4. **Run Traversals**: Choose a traversal algorithm and watch the animation
5. **Control Playback**: Use play/pause/reset controls and adjust playback speed
6. **View Details**: Check the step log panel for detailed operation information

### Advanced Features
- **Skip Animation**: Use the checkbox to perform operations instantly
- **Pan & Zoom**: Drag to pan, use zoom controls to navigate large trees
- **Info Modal**: Click the info button (i) to learn about each tree type
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle theme from command palette

### Keyboard Shortcuts
